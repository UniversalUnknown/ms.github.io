                        <p>
                            I have a passion for <strong>automation</strong> and
                            <strong>problem-solving</strong>, enjoying the
                            challenge of finding innovative solutions. My
                            interests include exploring articles and resources
                            beyond traditional books, as well as troubleshooting
                            <strong>circuit errors</strong> in electrical
                            engineering.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I do also have strong passion towards games
                            espicially Half-Life 2 and games like Factoria.
                            <br />
                            Though Simulation Looks good,sometimes action kicks
                            the vibe and open-world adventure fuels it. <br />
                            Perfect Game for me yet now is
                            <strong>GTA SA</strong> and <strong>4</strong>,

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Animes/Mangas and Manhwas/Novels like
                            <strong>Usogui</strong>,
                            <strong>Twenty-First Century Boys</strong>,
                            <strong>The Greatest Estate Developer</strong>,
                            <strong>Monsters</strong>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I am preaty intrested towards Non-Fictional and
                            dark-theme books like Psychology of Money,
                            Fahrenheit 451, The Art of War and books of Fyodor
                            Dostoyevsky. <br />
                            Russians and Germans plays have Top-Notch style in
                            touching Dark-themes of this human realm and goes
                            through deap understanding of this world and life.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I am deeply intrested and passionated in sectors
                            like physics, electronics and anything that are
                            <b>Researchable</b>. <br />
                            Reaserch is my true passion and not sitting in a
                            class and going through trauma. <br />
                            I really want to research in sectors i never
                            understand and go crazy full-mode into understanding
                            anything. My only source of dopamine is
                            understanding unknowns and finding possibly anything
                            to everything and thats what my life has to be,
                            locked alone in home and going through my Darwin's
                            Playground analysing from anything to everything.<br />
                            But my dull performance in studies pushes me back. I
                            gets excited everytime i hear about research and try
                            every method to get in but i got no time to
                            understand whats going on around me, thats why i
                            turned my intrests towards philosophy and perceive
                            as my intrest.
                            <br />
                            Hope one day I end my parents burden and continue my
                            researches i left on my 12th studies. <br />
                            We all hope everything changes for everyone.
